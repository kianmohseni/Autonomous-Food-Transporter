The purpose of this project was to design, build, and program an autonomous food transport device that can maneuver around an obstacle course called ”Mount Bruin.” A combination of sensors (ultrasonic, line tracking, and more) and computer programming through MATLAB and Simulink provide the robot with autonomous capabilities. To this effect, three initial concepts were developed, and based on a pairwise comparison chart and an objectives tree, we chose the design with a scooping mechanism. A detailed CAD model of this design was then created in SolidWorks, with all electronic components included. Using the estimated weight of the device and properties of the device in SolidWorks, tractive force and power requirements are calculated and presented, as well as relevant calculations for the food retrieval motor and subsystem.
